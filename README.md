# Email Tracker Browser Extension

A comprehensive browser extension for Chrome/Edge that tracks email delivery and open status in real-time.

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Core Components

- **Tracking Pixel Generator**: Creates unique 1x1 transparent GIFs with UUID identifiers
- **Email Client Integration**: Seamlessly works with Gmail and Outlook web interfaces
- **Real-time Dashboard**: Provides instant visibility into email tracking status
- **Read Receipt System**: Verifies when emails are opened and links are clicked

### 2. Technical Implementation

- **Content Scripts**: Inject tracking pixels into email compose windows
- **Background Service Worker**: Monitors and processes tracking events
- **REST API Endpoints**: Log pixel loads and click events
- **Database Schema**: Stores tracking data including UUIDs, timestamps, and user information

### 3. Key Features

- Automatic pixel insertion in compose windows
- Geolocation tracking from pixel loads
- Device/browser detection
- Link click tracking
- Email client compatibility across major platforms

### 4. Security Considerations

- GDPR compliance measures
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Rate limiting for pixel endpoints
- Privacy dashboard for users

### 5. Deployment Strategy

- Cross-browser manifest configuration
- Server infrastructure requirements
- Error handling for failed deliveries
- Analytics integration

## Implementation Details

This extension uses web beacons with 1x1 transparent GIFs, implements ETag headers for open verification, and considers WebSockets for real-time updates. It includes manual tracking toggles for user control and avoids dark patterns to maintain ethical standards.
